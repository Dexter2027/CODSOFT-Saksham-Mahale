ðŸ§  Machine Learning Mini Projects

This repository contains four mini machine learning projects focused on real-world classification tasks. Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and conclusions using different machine learning techniques.

 ðŸ“Œ TASK 1: Movie Genre Classification
Objective:
Predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.

Techniques Used:
- Text Preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Classification Algorithms:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `nltk`, `matplotlib`

ðŸ“Œ TASK 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Objective:
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on transaction data.

Techniques Used:
- Data balancing (e.g., undersampling or SMOTE)
- Feature Scaling
- Classification Algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest

Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`



ðŸ“Œ TASK 3: Customer Churn Prediction

Objective:
Predict whether a customer will churn from a subscription-based service.

Techniques Used: 
- Feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical data)
- Feature scaling
- Classification Algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting

Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `xgboost`, `matplotlib`


ðŸ“Œ TASK 4: Spam SMS Detection

Objective: 
Classify SMS messages as spam or ham (legitimate).

Techniques Used: 
- Text Preprocessing
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Classification Algorithms:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines

libraries:`scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
